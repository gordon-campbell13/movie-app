# MovieNight

A React application that allows users to search, save, and update their next movie night list. 

## What does it do?
This applications integrates with a RESTful API to search and display movie data. The user has the ability to then select the desired movie from the search result list which will then persist across within the application.

## Things to work on
- Currently, users need to add their own link to a SQL database for persistence
- Need to optimize the rendering of search results and the transition from search to save 
- Want to add in a login workflow for unique users

## To get started
- Download application
- Run `npm run build` to bundle application
- Run `npm start` to spin-up server and open application
